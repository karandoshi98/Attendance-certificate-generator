# Attendance-certificate-generator
Attendance certificate generator is a python based desktop application which generates an attendance certificate for external examiners conducting practicals and orals in our college and also keeps a record of all the external examiners who conducted the practicals. This was first implemented with SQLite and then using Firebase to maintain the record online.
